# My 3ds Max hotkey scripts
## What is this
This scripts are my attempt to unify my hotkey preferences for 3d modeling and solve some issues I'm having with 3ds Max. 
I'm making this repository for myself so I won't lost them. There is zero practical use for anybody else.

## Why
For example I dont need `Chamfer` for Edges and `Bevel` for Polygons as two separate commands - I want to have one button for beveling procedure no matter what component I'm selecting.

Raycasting selection is still garbage in 3ds Max and quick extrude does not work if May navigation preset is used.

## Installation
Put this scripts to `..3ds Max\scripts\startup' directory.`

Scripts will be available in under `keshon83` category.
(Optional) Import my hotkey file.
Scripts started with `Launcher..` are intended to use with 3rd party plugins.

## Credits
I wrote this scripts in 2016. Some scripts was written by different people (for example `PaintSelector` in `RaycastPaintSelection.ms` file). All credits go to their authors.
